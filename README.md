# **Credit Card Fraud Detection**  
A machine learning-based project designed to identify fraudulent transactions using Random Forest and SMOTE for class balancing.

## **Overview**  
**Credit Card Fraud Detection** focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains anonymized transaction features, and the model learns to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent. To address class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is applied, ensuring more balanced training data.
